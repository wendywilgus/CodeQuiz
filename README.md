# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

Module 4 Assignment

## Description
The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with an example of a coding test that you may be given at an interview.  I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, a timer, and a record of high scores.  This app is designed to run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Solving the problems of this project taught me to understand better the relationships between variables and functions in JavaScript, as well as ways to store data to local storage and call it back in the form of a displayed array.
